# Project Accomplishments: Ferreteria POS

This document outlines the key features and milestones achieved in the Ferreteria POS project up to this point.

## I. Core System & Data Management

1.  **Database Setup:**
    *   A robust data layer has been established using **Entity Framework Core** with a **SQLite** database.
    *   The database schema is well-defined with entities for `Productos` (Products), `Clientes` (Clients), `Ventas` (Sales), `VentaItems` (Sale Items), and `Configuracion` (System Configuration).
    *   Database migrations are in place, allowing for controlled schema evolution and updates.
    *   A data seeding mechanism has been implemented to populate the database with initial data, supporting import from Excel files (`5 mayo inventario.xlsx` for products, `clientes.xlsx` for clients) or using sample data if Excel files are not found.

2.  **Data Access Services:**
    *   A comprehensive set of services (`ProductosService`, `ClientesService`, `VentasService`, `InventarioService`) provide structured access for Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on all major entities.
    *   A central `RepositoryService` acts as a facade, simplifying access to these individual data services and managing dependencies like the `FerreteriaContext` and `ThermalPrinterService`.
    *   Transactional integrity is ensured for critical operations like sales processing and inventory updates.

## II. User Interface (WPF Application - `FerreteriaPOS.UI`)

1.  **Main Application Window:**
    *   A `MainWindow` serves as the central hub of the application, providing a tab-like navigation system (using F-keys F1-F5) to access different modules: Ventas (Sales), Clientes (Clients), Productos (Products), and Configuración (Settings).
    *   The application initializes the database and seeds it on startup.
    *   Keyboard shortcuts are implemented for common actions and navigation.

2.  **Sales Module (Ventas - F1):**
    *   **Product Entry:** Products can be added to a sale by typing/scanning a barcode or searching via a modal window (F10).
    *   **Bulk Items:** Support for "GRANEL" (bulk) items, prompting for quantity via a dedicated window.
    *   **Client Association:** Clients can be searched and associated with a sale. Marking a sale for a specific client automatically flags it as an invoice (`EsFactura`).
    *   **Calculations:** Real-time calculation of item subtotals, sale subtotal, IVA (taxes - 19% if `EsFactura`), and grand total.
    *   **Sale Processing:**
        *   The system validates stock before processing a sale.
        *   Successful sales update product inventory levels and record the transaction details.
    *   **Hold/Retrieve Sales:** Sales can be put "on hold" (F6) and retrieved later for completion.
    *   **Payment Screen (F12):** A dedicated screen for processing payments, showing amounts and calculating change.
    *   **Ticket Printing:** Functionality to print sales tickets to a thermal printer, with configurable store details.
    *   **Common Products (CTRL+P):** Ability to add non-cataloged ("common") items to a sale with on-the-fly description, quantity, and price.
    *   **View Daily Sales:** A window to view sales made during the day (initial implementation).
    *   **Re-print Last Ticket:** Basic functionality to show information about the last ticket, intended for reprinting.

3.  **Client Management Module (Clientes - F2):**
    *   **Client Listing & Search:** Displays a list of all clients with search/filter capabilities (by RUT, Name, Email).
    *   **CRUD Operations:** Clients can be added, edited, and deleted through a dedicated `ClienteFormWindow`.
    *   **Import from Excel:** Clients can be imported from an `clientes.xlsx` file, with checks for duplicates.
    *   **Purchase History:** Users can view the purchase history for a selected client in `HistorialClienteWindow`, filterable by date.

4.  **Product Management Module (Productos - F3):**
    *   **Product Catalog:** Displays a list of all products with search/filter capabilities (by Barcode, Description, Category, etc.).
    *   **CRUD Operations:** Products can be added, edited, and deleted using `ProductoFormWindow`. Deletion is prevented if the product is part of existing sales.
    *   **Import from Excel:** Products can be imported from an `5 mayo inventario.xlsx` file, checking for duplicate barcodes.
    *   Low stock items are visually highlighted in the product list.

5.  **Configuration Module (Configuración - F5):**
    *   **Store Information:** Configuration for store name, address, and phone number (displayed on tickets).
    *   **Thermal Printer Setup (`ConfiguracionImpresoraWindow`):**
        *   Enable/disable thermal printing.
        *   Option for automatic ticket printing upon sale completion.
        *   Selection between direct Windows printer connection or Serial Port (COM) connection.
        *   Configuration of printer name, serial port parameters (port, baud rate, data bits, parity, stop bits).
        *   Lists available printers and serial ports.
        *   "Test Print" functionality to verify printer setup.
    *   **Database Backup/Restore:** (Methods exist in `RepositoryService`, UI planned).

## III. Codebase & Project Management

1.  **Code Cleanup:**
    *   Several redundant `.bat` and `.ps1` build/utility scripts were identified and removed to simplify the codebase.
    *   The `.gitignore` file is in use to exclude unnecessary files from version control.
2.  **Version Control:**
    *   The project is managed using Git, and changes (including file deletions) have been committed and pushed to the remote GitHub repository (`https://github.com/Kev1nv30/POS`).
3.  **Documentation & Summarization:**
    *   A detailed code-level summary (`resumen.md`) has been generated, documenting the structure and functionality of each key file and component.
    *   This `done.md` file provides a higher-level overview of project accomplishments.

## IV. Development Environment & Helpers

*   The application is developed in C# using WPF for the UI and .NET.
*   Various helper classes (`DialogHelper`, `PaymentScreenHelper`, `ProductSearchHelper`, `ClientSearchHelper`, `NavigationHelper`, `KeyboardHelper`, `SalesHelper`, `ProductManagementHelper`, `ClientManagementHelper`) have been implemented to modularize UI logic and improve code organization within the `MainWindow`.
*   The "Sprints" folder contains older, more procedural code that has largely been integrated into or superseded by the helper classes and ViewModel logic for better MVVM adherence, though some direct calls to static methods in `Sprint1_Clientes` and `Sprint3_Productos` still exist within their respective helper classes.

This summary reflects the major advancements and implemented features. The system provides a solid foundation for a Point of Sale application with core functionalities for sales, inventory, client management, and configuration.
